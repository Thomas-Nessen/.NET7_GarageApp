# .NET7_GarageApp
This repo is my introduction project to .NET7, intented to learn about database setups / connections.
The initial set up was done by Frenk Reemer. I later added the database struture and CRUD methods.
The app design would mimic a garage app where you can sign-up, park and unpark you car, etc. 

My goal was to learn how to work with:
- Models
- Interfaces
- Schemas
- SQL Stored Procedures
- Postman
